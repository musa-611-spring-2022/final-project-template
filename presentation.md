Hi, I am Shaun. Today I am going to present my final project Dogs in New York City. It is the continued of my midterm project. Ok, for the project, the target people are those dog owners in New York City. The use case is that the website will serve as a guidebook, providing information from the beginning of the journey, adopting a dog to dog raisings and even to the dog friend network.

<First Part>
So the first part is to provide information about dog runs. We know that except human beings, dogs also want to strech their legs and be closer to the nature. So the dog owners can use this map to find out the nearest dog run around them and obtain the information about **area  and even **dig deeper through the google** to obtain other information. And they can also obtain the weather information in my website, here I use the weather api to provide the real time weather information.

And a side note, Rockway Freeway Dog Park is the biggest dog run in NYC, **its area is 8259 sqm**.

<Second Part>

The second part is about the dog licenses. Here dog owners can meet their curiosities and have specific information in the zipcode level such as the total number, average age, the percentage of female dogs and male dogs etc. There are two ways to know the information around your zipcode. One way is to **click the marker in the map.** **Another way** is to **enter the zipcode (10010)** to see the information. Of course, you can also scale back to the origin by **clicking  the marker**

And a side note, the most popular breed in NYC is the Yorkshire Terrier, which kinda makes sense. Because small dogs are more suitable in the crowded apartment.

<Third Part>

as dog owners, we always want to buy snacks and toys for our dogs. In this part, I plot out the pet stores. Every downer can **click through each one** to obtain **specifc information.

And also we know that travelling with dogs takes a lot of effort. Here I provide 60 dog friendly hotels in nyc. I found these information through google place api. Each time before the trip to NYC, dog owners can take a look at the map to find out the hotel to live in. And they can directly go to the booking page through our website.

<fourth part>

And I also provide information about the animal hospital for the emergent need. People can see the overall ratings in the page and even decide the transportation through one click. Here I use the geolocation api to track the device's location.

<fifth part>

If people decide to raise a dog, I provide the information about the dog breeder and rescues in NYC. they are displayed in two different color as in the legend. 

<sixth part>

Finally, it is the most difficult part in this project. Because I always feel dogs will be lonely, and I really want to build a network for them to make friends. This is the pin points when I raised my dog. We don't know where the other dogs are or we can not regularly meet a dog. So here I build up a dog friend network. It is made up of two parts, the front end and the backend. The backend is a database server where all the dog information in this network are stored. And in the front end, I provide people opportunities to register as a member of this network. Eventually, the information will get into the database. As time goes by, the network can be huge and really provides a great opportunity for each dog to make friends. The most difficult part is to setup the database and post and fetch the information to or through the port. And I am really grateful for the help of Mjumbe and John. It is their help to make this project possible.

Thanks
