# MUSA 611 Final Project

## Project Proposal

# LA HISTORIA EN EL VIEJO SAN JUAN

In collaboration with Puerto Rican native, Nick Quijano, and the vision of tenured Puerto Rican residents in Old San Juan, this project is seeking to develop an interactive map for residents to add memories. The goal is for the local Puerto Ricans to reclaim their heritages within their spaces. The project was developed from a fieldwork trip in Spring 2022 from a Historic Preservation Studio "Urban Regeneration in the Americas" at the University of Pennsylvania. The data depicted in the maps in the tabs to the left depict the conflicting uses of historic public spaces by the residents as a result of the increasing population of tourists and expats. The Home Value tab displays the current Zillow home sale prices nearest to the plaza, as a way for residents to stay up to date of new developments and potential threats of touristification. In addition, the Sounds tab captures our meetings with architects, planners, artists, and anthropologists and most importantly the conflicting sounds from the past and the present.


# THE PURPOSE:

The people of Viejo San Juan believe in maintaining their historic culture, however the historic conservation process needs a better system to protect Puerto Rican heritage. This app- "Amplificar el Patrimonio" is a tool that democratizes the conservation process, and allows the local residents to collectively advocate with local architects, city planners, and conservationists to save their historic places.

# THE USER:

The primary user in this case are the local residents themselves, specifically elderly residents who value the historic squares the most. The residents will be able to keep track of home values as a way to advocate for more policies against touristification causing increases in housing costs and thus displacement. In the Amplificar el Patrimonio 2.0, residents will be able to add their own memories as a tool for protecting public collective memories, as well as improving digital literacy amongst older populations in Viejo San Juan.

The secondary users will be the architects, city planners, and conservationists to keep track of which specific historic spaces to prioritize based on public input and proximate home sale prices. Further, with intense development and renovations in Viejo San Juan, conservationists can use this tool as a platform to advocate for stricter design guidelines to protect the historic identity and heritage of the city.

# FEATURES:

-   Updated real estate properties in closest proximity to historic plazas with subsequent home sale prices and square footage

-   Eventually, the site/app can be updated weekly with new home sale prices

-   Collective updates of new public memories including pictures, stories, sounds, and written memories. The "Sounds" tab can eventually be used as a public kiosk for residents to share their public memories and vouch to protect their heritage of place
-   Data scraped from Zillow home sale prices.
