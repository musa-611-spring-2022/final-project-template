### Project Proposal: Community Asset Map and Census 2020 Impact for Laal NYC (Norwood, Bronx, NYC)

* Purpose: To increase response rates to the Census in 2020, the government disseminated funding to community based organizations in major urban centers to conduct outreach to educate communities about the importance of filling out the census and how it can impact them thereby encouraging them to fill out the Census and to dispel misinformation about the Census. At Laal NYC, an organization that works with Bengali womxn to live joyful lives, conducted outreach via phone banking to its community in Norwood, an area in the northwest Bronx, to provide education, and assist in language translation when filling out the census forms. In addition to helping households fill out the census, Laal conducted their own demographic survey with questions that aligned with census questions with the goal of being able to demonstrate their impact and reach. Since the Census was conducted at the beginning of the pandemic, Laal also asked questions about the impact of COVID-19 and financial security during this time period as well as voter registration.
* Data Sources: 

   - Census 2020 Data for census block groups in Norwood (could use Census API or can be downloaded into Excel or CSV)
   - Laal Demographic Survey that lives in Alchemer (formerly SurveyGizmo) but can be downloaded into Excel or a CSV file

* Analysis: % of Laal Demographic Survey counts of individuals and households that contributed to the Census 2020 total numbers for the block groups that make up Norwood, BX.
* Functionality: Ideally, the feature would be pop-ups showing the population of South Asians (specifically Bengali/Bangladeshi), their income and employment statistics in Norwood by census block groups based on the Census 2020 data. The second part of the pop-up, or could be a filtering mechanism, would show the percent of people that were counted through Laal's outreach. The third part of the pop-up would show the results of the additional questions asked about financial, voter registration and food security. 
* Audience: The map could be posted on Laal's website as an interactive means of exploring the data collected by Laal, the impact Laal has had on the Norwood community and to illustrate the importance of opening offices in Grand Concourse and Parkchester. The target audience is funders, granters, foundations, and local and state government entities that visit the organizations website. Additionally, Laal is transitioning from a C3 (non-profit) to C4 (political action committee), to advocate for political participation and power for the Bengali community to the NYC local government and NY State government. By viewing the numbers and reach Laal has, government agencies can see the organization as a source of voters that need to be taken seriously as its a community that has been over looked despite growth rates of nearly 200% in the past three decades.
