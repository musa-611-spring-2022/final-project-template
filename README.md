# Project Proposal - Carbon Sinks on Abandoned Lands

### MUSA 611 Final Project Team: Hui Tian

## Introduction

Thousands of hazardous waste and abandoned sites are dotted throughout the U.S. landscape. They represent a significant remediation challenge, but also the potential of other ecological and community benefits. This research project considers abandoned land’s carbon storage potential, investigating the contribution that a beneficial reuse of the nation’s hazardous waste and abandoned sites for carbon storage could have, while visualizing the social and ecological benefits of such a strategy. It entails mapping and describing the variety of abandoned land typologies, research into remediation and afforestation strategies for these sites, and development of a Landscape Strategy Toolkit that explains their social, ecological, and carbon benefits.

## Goal

Make an interactive website with skills learned from JavaScript class to introduce the distribution and typologies of abandoned lands to the public, as well as providing Landscape Strategies of remediation and afforestation.
